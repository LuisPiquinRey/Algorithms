     * Alright, the Binary Search algorithm follows a simple rule: the array must be sorted. Once this is done, it follows
     * very basic principles â€” subdividing the data collection into two partitions (dividing it in half). What we do is find
     * out which half contains the target. If the element is greater than arr[mid], that means the target we are looking for must
     * be in the upper half. Once this is understood, we simply repeat the same process.
